# AmerBecic Retail Manager
This is a demo for a Retail Manager. 


Having accumulated 2 years of experience with the MVC design pattern, I've chosen to embark on a challenging journey to explore and construct something using the MVVM architecture. 

Looking ahead, I intend to further develop this application using the MVC.

##Description

Again this is a demo, with MVP bulding style. Main focus is on the functionalities of backend part of the application.
While I do have plans to improve Frontend part of the application, but probably not in a near future.

This application allows you to buy Products from Inventory. 
There are 3 types of users (Admin, Cashier and Manager).
Every role has certain limitations, for example only Admin can see info and roles about other users and edit them.

Technologies used:

- .Net MVVM (in future MVC)
- Dapper and EF
- SQL
- Git
- Bootstrap
